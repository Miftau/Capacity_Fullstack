        RECRUITING <br><br>

    In the process of making better Islamic society and community around the globe, 
    DAARU-L-ILM consider the sayings that “An idle hand is a workshop of Satan“. 
    Our society will be great and better if those with talents are able to find 
    organizations to use their talents the way they like with proper guidance from experts in that field. 
    DAARU-L-ILM thereby included recruitment in her programs to employ talented and hardworking Muslims 
    into the educational field and other organizational posts and also uses the opportunity to train 
    the less talented but hardworking Muslims that are ready to learn to make them realize their 
    dreams by the grace of Allah. <br>
    This recruiting process has procedures with no bias. 
    Individuals are employed based on merit and capability and not on familiarity or 
    favoritism as DAARU-L-ILM‘s administrative panel believed that is the only way to make 
    the world better by setting the opportunity for people that have nobody to become somebody 
    without needing to necessarily know anybody. <br>
    Whenever there are job vacancies at DAARU-L-ISLAMIC ISLAMIC STUDIES, 
    they will be placed on our events and blog pages and applicants will be able to 
    complete their application processes online.
